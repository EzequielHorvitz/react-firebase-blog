This capstone proyect creates a functional, responsive blog, using react, python, redux, scss, css, firebase and javascript. The app is deployed in heroku in the following link: https://react-capstone-project.herokuapp.com/

In the blog, a User can register, login, add, edit and delete post and see all his post and all the post from someone else. 

The users for the created post are juan@gmail.com and and pepe@gmail.com, both with a 123456 password. 

The data is passed with the API, but I render it with firebase because it renders faster with Firebase realtime database. 

Also, in the styling section I have added the specific styles for the main browers.
